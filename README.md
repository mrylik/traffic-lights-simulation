## School task - Traffic lights simulation

The task was to create a visual representation of a simple juncture.
I chose to carry out this task in Tkinter, as we were not authorised to
install any external libraries.
The whole cycle was supposed to be exactly 15 seconds, so I've included 
a simple timer as well.
